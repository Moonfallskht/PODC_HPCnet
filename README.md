# HPCnet
Robust photon-level single-pixel imaging through diverse scattering media

## Simulation scripts
- **fog.py** — simplified fog simulation script for generating synthetic scattering-degraded images.  
  Parameters are not yet fully adapted to all datasets and may require tuning for different scattering conditions.
## Notes
The fog simulation script provides a baseline degradation model for subsequent preprocessing and network training (e.g., PODC, U-Net, and HPCnet).
